Before jumping into the details, let us understand why we actually need joining / merging. Whenever we have some information split and available into two or more data sets and we want to combine them into a single dataset, we need to merge / join these tables. One of the main things to be kept in mind is that the merging should be based on common criteria or field. For example, In a retail company, we have a daily Transaction table (Table contains Products Detail, Sales Detail and Customers Detail) and Inventory table (which has Product Detail and Available quantity).

One of the advantage of using Decision tree is that it efficiently identifies the most significant variable and splits thepopulation on it. In previous article, we developed a high level understanding of Decision trees. In this article, we will focus on the science behind splitting the nodes and choosing the most significant split.
Decision trees can use various algorithms to split a node in two or more sub-nodes. The creation of sub-nodes increases the homogeneity of resultant sub-nodes. In other words, we can say that purity of the node increases with respect to the target variable. Decision tree splits the nodes on all available variables and then selects the split which results inmost homogeneous sub-nodes.
